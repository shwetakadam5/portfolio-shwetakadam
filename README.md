# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

A web application for the portfolio of work has been developed to showcase the skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.
The development of this application has helped me apply the knowledge of HTML, CSS, various styling and transition options of CSS , flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
